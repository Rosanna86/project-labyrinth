# Project Labyrinth

This is a pair programming project made by Rosanna Dahlberg and Maria Thomasson.

In this week's project we built a game which allows the user to navigate a maze in the form of a text-based adventure, provided by a backend.

We used an API specified to build a frontend which gives the user control over what to do next. We focused on using thunks and redux to build the communication with the backend.  

## The problem

We started out by creating all the reducers and basic components to get all the funcnionality to work. After we got the API to work and the game to appear we added a animated loader from Lottie. After the functions were set we started with styling.

We decided to go for a fanasty theme and to style the app with styled components. To make it more to look like a fantasty game we added different backgrounds depending on where you are in the game, one for the Start Page, In Game Page, Loading Page and The End Page. On the Loading page we also added a spinnig compass. When the app was all finished we decided to add some music to get a real "game-feeling". 

Working as a pair has been really fun and the project has been going smoothly, we are really proud and satisfied over this project!
